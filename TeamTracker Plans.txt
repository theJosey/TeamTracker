How is my team doing? 

Will grab standings from the internet somehow? (easier said than done...) 
Will give general statement about team overall and past couple of games 

For now focus on Baseball 
then add more in the future?
basically needs to be a one page site?
Maybe different pages per sport? 

Will likely need API of each site? 
not sure how else to get info...

my god 
https://appac.github.io/mlb-data-api-docs/#header-getting-started
but does not have win/lose data for teams!
still a fun player database?? 
maybe a good fantasy site???

This is what we want 
https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-baseball/endpoints

need to incorporate api into project but

ex for Tampa Bay rays 
get":"standings"
"parameters":{4 items
"league":"1"
"team":"34"
"stage":"MLB"
"season":"2020"
}

will need big dropdown and if/else for team ids? 
or way to grab team ids using team name that can be set with dropdown 
so this can totally work

****** Problem with Local Host not loading **********
It seems to be a problen of cache. I had the same problem, 
but just running in another port everything works fine, for example 
npm run dev -- --port 3001

sigh, can't get it to do anything, maybe python or C# is the way to go.....
